Installation
------------

To install %%MODNAME%% you need at least : 

    OCaml %%OCAMLVERSION%% %%PPDEPS%%

If you have `findlib`, it can be installed by typing :

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build 
    ocaml setup.ml -install

If you don't, `%%NAME%%.mli` and `%%NAME%%.ml` contain everything, the
code, the documentation and the license. Install the dependencies and
use the sources the way you want. For example if you use `ocamlbuild`
you can issue the following commands from the root directory of your
project:

    ln -s /path/to/%%NAME%%-%%VERSION%%/src %%NAME%%
    echo "<%%NAME%%> : include" >> _tags


Documentation
-------------

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from `%%NAME%%.mli`. For you convenience you can find a
generated version in the `doc` directory of the distribution.


Sample programs
---------------

A test program, `xmltrip`, is provided in the `test` directory. It can
be built with :

    ocamlbuild test/xmltrip.native

`xmltrip` reads XML files with %%MODNAME%% and outputs them back in various
ways. It is useful to understand how %%MODNAME%% handles documents. `xmltrip
-help` has more information.

If you need to parse XHTML, there is a file named `xhtml.ml` in the
`test` directory. It contains an OCaml list coupling each XHTML
character entity with its corresponding UTF-8 encoded character
string. You can use it to program a suitable entity callback.
